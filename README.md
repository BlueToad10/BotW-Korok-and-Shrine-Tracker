# BotW-Korok-and-Shrine-Tracker
This is my attempt at a Korok and Shrine tracker for The Legend Of Zelda Breath Of The Wild.

By left clicking one of the tower icons on the right, it will display the stats for the corresponding segment of the map.

By right clicking on a tower that has been activated, it will hide that area and the stats for it.

You can do this for any of the towers however you choose.



When you left click on the shrine icon or number next to it it goes down by 1 to represent that you have completed that shrine.

Of course right clicking it will do the opposite and add 1 to the shrines remaining.


Both of these rules are the same for the korok seed icon and number next to it below the shrines.


The segment stats also change the stats on the top left of the screen, which displays the total shrines and koroks you have completed or collected throughout your journey.



You can press ‘M’ to show just the map. Press again to return to normal.

And if you need, by pressing the space bar each segment will have numbers for corresponding the towers easier. Also press again to return to normal.



With all that said you can keep track of the important things in whatever way you want.
